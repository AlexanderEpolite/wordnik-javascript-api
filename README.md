# Wordnik API Client

### Note: this is a community made project, it is not affiliated with Wordnik.

## Why another Wordnik API?

The simple answer is that the other Wordnik APIs are older, and do not have built-in types, making it difficult to use
for TypeScript developers.

## Usage

Coming (very) soon :)

# WARNING

This API is very new.  I will be pushing changes soon to make sure it is ready to work in production environments.
